*MACBETH PLAY PROJECT*

This is a TDD project implemented to parse any play extracted from http://www.ibiblio.org/xml/examples/shakespeare/ and display how many times each character speaks. All appearances of "ALL" speaker are ignored.

* All tests are implemented in `spec` folder and code is implemented in `lib` folder.
* Default task from `Rakefile` file calls the parsing itself based on the `URL` constant variable.

This project was created using Ruby 2.4.1. Run `bundle install` and install all necessary gems before starting.
